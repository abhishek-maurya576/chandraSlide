# Project ChandraSlide: AI-Powered Lunar Landslide & Boulder Detection

Welcome to **Project ChandraSlide**, a research initiative to automate the detection and analysis of landslides and boulder falls on the Moon using deep learning and data from the Chandrayaan missions.

This repository contains all the source code for the project's multi-modal AI pipeline, **PRAJNA Fusion-Net**, and the interactive **PRAJNA Dashboard** for visualizing the results.

## üöÄ Quick Start

To launch the interactive dashboard directly:

1.  Ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the [Developer Guide](./docs/developer_guide.md).
2.  Run the following command from the project root:

    ```bash
    streamlit run dashboard/app.py
    ```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Training on Google Colab

Since training a deep learning model requires significant GPU resources, it is highly recommended to use Google Colab.

### 1. Data Setup on Google Drive

Because the dataset is too large to be stored on GitHub, you need to upload it to your Google Drive.

1.  Upload your raw dataset folders (e.g., `moon`, `mars`) to a directory in your Google Drive. For example, you might have it at `My Drive/ChandraSlide/datasets/`.

### 2. Colab Notebook Setup

1.  Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.
2.  **Clone the repository** into your Colab environment:
    ```python
    !git clone https://github.com/abhishek-maurya576/chandraSlide.git
    %cd chandraSlide
    ```
3.  **Mount your Google Drive** to access the dataset:
    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```
4.  **Create the necessary directory structure** and **copy the dataset** from your Drive into the cloned repository. This makes the files accessible to the training scripts.
    ```python
    # Create the directory for raw data
    !mkdir -p data/raw

    # Adjust the source path to match where you stored the data in your Drive
    # This command copies the 'moon' folder into the 'data/raw/' directory
    !cp -r "/content/drive/My Drive/ChandraSlide/datasets/moon" data/raw/
    ```
5.  **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```python
    !pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. Run Training

You are now ready to run the data preparation and training scripts.

1.  **Prepare the data for YOLOv8:**
    ```python
    !python -m src.data.prepare_yolo_data
    ```
2.  **Start the training process:**
    ```python
    # This first line helps prevent a common library conflict error in Colab
    import os
    os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK']='True'

    !python -m src.models.yolov8
    ```

The trained model will be saved in the `runs/` directory inside your Colab environment. You can then download it back to your local machine.

```

### Structure

The data is organized as follows:

- `data/raw/`: This directory contains the original, unaltered datasets (e.g., `moon/`, `mars/`). This data is not tracked by Git.
- `data/processed/`: This directory contains datasets that have been cleaned, transformed, or otherwise prepared for model training (e.g., `yolo_moon_dataset/`). The processed data files are not tracked by Git, but the directory structure and any configuration files are.

An example structure for the raw moon dataset is:

-   **Location:** `data/raw/moon/`
-   **Training Images:** `data/raw/moon/train_images/` (contains `.tif` files)
-   **Training Labels:** `data/raw/moon/train_labels/` (contains `train_classes_m.csv` and `train_labels_m.csv`)
-   **Test Images:** `data/raw/moon/test_images/` (contains `.tif` files)
-   **Test Labels:** `data/raw/moon/test_labels/` (contains `test_classes_m.csv` and `test_labels_m.csv`)
